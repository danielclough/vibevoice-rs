Speaker 1: It delivers a devastating one-two punch. First, when we clear forests, primarily for agriculture, we release the massive amounts of carbon that were stored in those trees and soils directly into the atmosphere. Between 2015 and 2020, the world continued to lose an estimated 10 million hectares of forest every single year. Second, by destroying the forest, we're eliminating a vital natural carbon sink that would otherwise be absorbing CO2 from the air. So it adds carbon while also reducing the planet's ability to clean it up.
